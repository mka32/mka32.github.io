            <h2>Key International Relations</h2>

            <div class="relations">
                <h3>1. India and the United States</h3>
                <p>India and the United States have shared strategic interests, particularly in defense, trade, and counterterrorism. The two nations have strengthened their relationship through various initiatives, including the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement and growing cooperation in defense and security.</p>
                
                <h3>2. India and China</h3>
                <p>India's relationship with China is complex, with both cooperation and competition. While the two nations are major economic partners, tensions exist, particularly over territorial disputes in regions like Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin, as well as strategic rivalry in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
                
                <h3>3. India and Russia</h3>
                <p>India and Russia share a long history of strong ties, particularly in defense and energy cooperation. Russia remains a key partner for India, especially in the context of military technology, defense equipment, and energy resources like oil and gas.</p>
                
                <h3>4. India and Pakistan</h3>
                <p>The relationship between India and Pakistan is strained due to historical conflicts, particularly over the Kashmir region. Despite numerous efforts to improve bilateral ties, including peace talks and trade, tensions persist, primarily due to security concerns and cross-border terrorism.</p>
                
                <h3>5. India and the European Union</h3>
                <p>The European Union is one of India's largest trading partners, and both sides share common interests in areas such as climate change, counterterrorism, and trade. India seeks to deepen its relationship with the EU to strengthen its global position and economic influence.</p>
                
                <h3>6. India and the Middle East</h3>
                <p>India maintains strong ties with countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iran. The region is important for India due to its reliance on oil imports and the large Indian diaspora working in the Gulf countries. India also engages in multilateral platforms like the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</p>
                
                <h3>7. India and Africa</h3>
                <p>India has been expanding its engagement with African nations, focusing on economic cooperation, trade, and development assistance. India’s relationship with Africa is underpinned by a shared history of colonialism and a commitment to mutual growth through initiatives like the India-Africa Forum Summit.</p>
                
                <h3>8. India and Southeast Asia</h3>
                <p>India has long-standing historical and cultural ties with Southeast Asia, and today, India’s “Act East” policy emphasizes closer economic and security cooperation with ASEAN countries. India aims to strengthen its presence in the Indo-Pacific region, focusing on trade, security, and infrastructure development.</p>
